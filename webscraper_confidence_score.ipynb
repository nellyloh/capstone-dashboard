In August, 20 counts of cheating involving more than $16 million and US$200,000 (S$269,000) were filed against him.\\n\\nOn Monday, he was hit with more counts of cheating involving $11.4 million and US$5.9 million. Ng, whose bail of $4 million was extended on Monday, is expected to be back in court on Dec 20.\\n\\nDeputy Public Prosecutor Kevin Yong asked the court for further mentions to be adjourned for eight more weeks in order to complete investigations.\\n\\n“We are not asking for an increase in bail now but we are reserving the rights to ask for this for the current set of (18) charges or any further charges that may be tendered,” he said.\\n\\nLawyer Rajvinder Singh Chahal, who is representing Ng, said he has no objection to the prosecution’s application but asked “how long more investigations will continue, and whether this adjournment is likely to be the last one”.\\n\\nDPP Yong said he “cannot confirm if this is the last adjournment for further investigations”.\\n\\nNg is a director of Envy Asset Management (EAM) and Envy Global Trading (EGT), which allegedly raised billions of dollars from investors for fake deals related to nickel trading. He was arrested in February this year and first charged with cheating and fraudulent trading in March.\\n\\nMonday’s charges alleged that Ng duped investors between last July and February this year into buying some receivables from EGT’s purported sale of nickel to BNP Paribas and a firm named Raffemet, when no such transactions were made.\\n\\nInvestors were allegedly promised varying returns, depending on the nickel trading schemes they joined.\\n\\nAlleged victims in past charges include Temasek Holdings general counsel Pek Siok Lan, Vickers Venture Partners founder Finian Tan and former Law Society president Thio Shen Yi.\\n\\nOn Monday, Ng was charged with forging false electronic records on various occasions between June 27, 2016 and Aug 12, 2020 for the purpose of cheating.\\n\\nAccording to charge sheets, he made false electronic records, between June 2016 and October 2019, of distribution agreements purportedly entered between EAM and Poseidon Nickel for the sale of nickel to EAM. This was allegedly done to dupe investors into believing that EAM had bought nickel from Poseidon.\\n\\nNg was also charged with making false electronic records, on various occasions between December 2019 and August 2020, of forward contracts purportedly entered between BNP Paribas Commodity Futures and EAM and EGT for the sale of nickel. This was allegedly done to dupe investors into believing EAM and EGT had entered into forward contracts with BNP.\\n\\nNg was also charged with abetting to instigate a Ju Xiao to lodge a false document with the Registrar of Companies claiming that the amount of paid-up share capital for EGT had been raised from $1,000 to $100 million, when there was allegedly no such increase.\\n\\nIf convicted, Ng could be jailed for up to 10 years and fined for each count of cheating.\\n\\nFor each count of fraudulent trading, he could be jailed for up to seven years, fined up to $15,000, or both. For each count of forgery, he could be jailed for up to four years and fined.\\n\\nFor each count of lodging false or misleading documents to the Registrar of Companies, he could be jailed for up to two years, fined up to $50,000, or both.',\n",

       "  'text': 'SINGAPORE (BLOOMBERG) - Technology start-up investor Vickers Venture Partners has been caught up in the allegedly fraudulent nickel trading scheme of a Singaporean businessman and his Envy Global Trading, prompting a review by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).\\n\\nVickers would be the highest-profile investor yet to have fallen victim to the suspected billion-dollar swindle, which Singapore authorities have said could be the biggest investment fraud the financial hub has ever seen. The alleged mastermind, Ng Yu Zhi, has been charged with a range of suspected crimes from faking the purchase and sale of nickel to falsifying transfers from Citibank and account statements that showed millions in funds.\\n\\nLicensed fund managers must have policies to manage risks, including proper checks before investments, MAS said in an emailed response to Bloomberg\\'s queries on Thursday (May 6). \"We are performing a supervisory review\" of Vickers Venture Partners (S) Pte Ltd. to \"ascertain that it has met these requirements.\"\\n\\nVickers Venture\\'s founder Finian Tan said in a reply to Bloomberg\\'s query that he was a personal investor in the receivable financing funds floated by Envy Global Trading, which authorities believe involved false contracts. Two Vickers funds were also investors in companies with exposure to the same trade, he said, adding that the initial due diligence process did not raise any red flags.\\n\\nMr Tan also confirmed that Ng is among investors in a company that made a small investment in Vickers and another company that put a small amount in one of its seven funds. A representative for Ng didn\\'t immediately respond to an emailed query.\\n\\nVickers has US$953 million (S$1.27 billion) of assets under management, including co-investments. Its founder and chairman was an early investor in Chinese technology giant Baidu Inc. Vickers said in 2020 it received US$200 million in commitments for its sixth fund, which is targeted at US$500 million.\\n\\n\"We are expecting this year to be the best ever year for both funds even if we have to write off the RFEGT investments to zero,\" Mr Tan said in a statement, referring to the receivable financing investment. \"As venture capitalists, we swing for the fences. And when mistakes occur, we should of course try to minimise them.\"\\n\\nMr Tan said his fund\\'s ability to hit a \"home-run\" by taking risks has allowed it to produce outsized returns in the past. \"If we slow down our swing and can no longer hit home-runs, then we are done for.\"\\n\\nThe fraud allegations against Ng centre on his dealings at Envy Asset Management and Envy Global Trading, companies he controlled and where he was a director. Of the more than $1 billion that was invested in the companies, $300 million was transferred to Ng\\'s personal account while an estimated $200 million remains unaccounted for, prosecutors alleged in court proceedings last month.\\n\\nWhile investors received payments worth $700 million, they\\'re owed another $1 billion based on the face value of outstanding contracts, prosecutors said.\\n\\nSingapore\\'s High Court last week approved KPMG as the interim judicial manager of three companies that are linked to the case.',\n",

It is also only the latest in a row of scandals, including oil giant Hin Leong.\\n\\nEven though there is little known about Ng’s transactions, court proceedings show that he gained investors by claiming average quarterly gains of 15 per cent, which Bloomberg says rivals the performance of the best hedge fund managers around the globe.\\n\\n- Advertisement 1-\\n\\nAt present, Ng is free on a S$1.5 million bail, but is subject to electronic monitoring. His lawyer Davinder Singh, the executive chairman of Davinder Singh Chambers, did not respond to Bloomberg’s queries.\\n\\nWhether or not the disgraced trader has entered a plea is still unknown.\\n\\nThe Commercial Affairs Department seized S$100 million of assets from Ng, including the Pagani Huayra supercar, which is valued at between S$7 million and S$8 million; as well as his Porsche 911 GT3.\\n\\nNg is a director of Envy Asset Management and Envy Global Trading, which are now being investigated by the police.\\n\\nHowever, charges have been brought only against the trader.\\n\\nEnvy Asset has ceased to be active, according to a representative of Envy Global in February.\\n\\nEnvy Asset was put on the investor alert list of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last year, Bloomberg added.

However, he never made such purchases.\\n\\nHe also lied to investors when he said he was buying contracts from French lender BNP Paribas SA. According to the charge sheets, he did not.\\n\\nEnvysion Wealth Management, one of the investors in Ng’s companies, spoke to Bloomberg.

The companies have not been charged.\\n\\n\"The companies\\' assets...are grossly insufficient to meet the potential claims of the companies\\' creditors,\" the interim judicial managers said in their report, dated Tuesday.\\n\\n\"We recommend the companies be placed into liquidation and that appropriate steps be taken as soon as practicable to recover the assets of the companies.\"\\n\\nThe report said the scheme purportedly raised about S$1.5 billion ($1.13 billion) from nearly 1,000 investors, with about S$731 million of this later withdrawn by investors.\\n\\nAuthorities have previously said at least S$1 billion was raised in the scheme.\\n\\nThe managers, led by Bob Yap, a KPMG partner in Asia, declined to comment on the report on grounds of confidentiality.\\n\\nEnvy Group and Ng did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe judicial managers\\' report also concluded that none of the funds from investors were used for nickel trades, and that any investment returns were likely to have come from investor funds.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDocuments were forged and a video of a nickel shipment inspection recorded to convince investors of the existence of the purported trading, the report added.\\n\\n\"We conclude that the objectives of judicial management cannot be achieved for any of the companies. There is, most significantly, no business for the judicial managers to preserve or continue,\" the managers said in the report.\\n\\nThe managers will continue investigations into the companies\\' affairs, they added.\\n\\nDuring the period from July 2020 to February 2021, EGT made nearly 1,200 fund transfers, totalling S$238.6 million, to two bank accounts, at least one of them belonging to Ng, the report said.\\n\\nNg made, or caused to be made, an average of 150 transfers a month and up to 41 transfers a day during this period, and separately received S$29 million in director\\'s fees, it said.\\n\\nNg has declined to meet the KPMG officials, it added.\\n\\nBesides Ng, the report identified Lee Si Ye as an ultimate beneficial owner of the Envy Group. Lee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nIf convicted, Ng faces a jail term of up to seven years on the fraudulent trading charges, while cheating is punishable with up to 10 years.\\n\\n($1=S$1.3240)\\n\\n(Additional reporting by Mai Nguyen in Hanoi and Aradhana Aravindan in Singapore; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)',\n",
